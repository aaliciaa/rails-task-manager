<h1>Task Index</h1>
<!-- Should display a list of all tasks and, for each task:
a link to its show view (use a link_to helper)
a link to its edit view
a link to its delete action. Hint: a standard link does not allow to perform DELETE request, so here you should add a method: :delete option to your link_to helper. -->

<!-- Should include a link to the new view to create a new task -->
<%= link_to "Add a task", new_task_url %>

<ul>
<% @tasks.each do |task| %>
<li>  <%= link_to task.name, task_path(task) %>
<%= link_to "Edit", edit_task_path(task) %>
<%= link_to "Delete", task_path(task),
        method: :delete,
        data: { confirm: "Are you sure?" } %>
</li>
<% end %>
</ul>
